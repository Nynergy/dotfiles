# install

It's how you install all this custom stuff, silly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Instructions

From within the base directory of the repo:

```
$ ./install/proliferate
```

It may ask you questions; read them, and respond.

After you're done, be sure to check the environment file that was
created/updated to see if there are placeholder values you need to fill in.
