## Slide Header

This is a test presentation file for use with `Sli`de `P`resenter, or '`slip`'.

### Controls

- `q` or `Escape` to exit
- `l`, `Space`, `Enter`, or `Right Arrow Key` to move to next slide
- `h`, `Backspace`, or `Left Arrow Key` to move to previous slide

---

## This is a slide

Slide contents. Yay. Have an inline `code` block.

> Here's a single line blockquote.

> Here's a multi-line one.
>
> It's even got a space in the middle.

> Perhaps you enjoy some...
>
>> Nested Blockquotes?!
>
> I thought so...

  > Not sure if this is legal Markdown, but...
  > It preserves the leading whitespace.

# Important title card

## Actual first level header

Things I like:

- Markdown
- Bash
- Bash built-ins :)
  - Nested lists ^_^

1. Numbered lists, too!
2. awdkankwdnj
3. andkjwkdjn
  1. You can nest these as well

# Another Title

## Some header

This is **bold** text, as is __this__.

This is *italic* text, as is _this_.

This text is both **_bold and italic_**.

This text is ==highlighted== to really get your attention.

### Some other header

* akjdakj
* adajwdndjwk
  * akdjnakwdjn
  * adjnakdjn
    * akjdnakdjwn
  * akdjn
* adj

## This is still part of the same subtitle

So the breadcrumb should work. Have a code block:

```
fn main() {
    let name = "John Doe";
    println!("Hello, {}! Here's a number: {}", name, 123);
}
```

And how about a task list:

- [ ] Get bread
- [~] Get a life
- [-] Acquire hardware
- [x] Program slip, for some reason
- [X] Free Space (BINGO!)

## Wow! Even More Stuff!

How about a table?

| ==ID== | ==Description==        | ==Other==  |
| -- | ------------------ | ------ |
|  1 | Number `One`         | __Odd__    |
|  3 | Number `Three`       | __Odd__    |
|  7 | Number `Seven`       | __Odd__    |
|----|--------------------|--------|
| 14 | Number `Fourteen`    | __Even__   |
| 32 | Number `Thirty-Two`  | __Even__   |

You can even include formatting inside the table!
